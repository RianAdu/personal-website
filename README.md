# Portfolio Website 2.0

This is an update of the 2016 version of my portfolio website. I added new projects and used bootstrap.

## Technolgies used for this project

## Design

The website uses the responsive bootstrap grid system. The single page design and was built using a **mobile first approach**. The modular scale for a more meaningful responsive typography was not changed.
